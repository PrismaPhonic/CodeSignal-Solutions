# First Duplicate

**The Problem**: 
Given an array 'a', that contains only numbers in        
the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for   
which the second occurance (The duplicate) has the lowest index 
(comes first)  

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:
My algorithm is at worst O(n) (assuming an array with no duplicates or only one
duplicate where the second occurance is the last element in the array)
